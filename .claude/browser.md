Spur Browser

# Claude Code Implementation Prompt: Spur Browser - Complete Super App

## Project Overview

You are tasked with implementing **Spur**, a revolutionary **standalone browser** that serves as an always-on, context-aware personal productivity companion. Spur is a complete web browser built from the ground up, integrating sophisticated digital footprint analysis, proactive assistance, natural voice interaction, and seamless tool integration into a unified browsing experience. This is not an extension—it's a full-featured browser that captures your digital patterns, guides your workflow, and operates as your intelligent digital partner.

### Core Philosophy
Spur is your **serene, integrated digital ecosystem** that operates on **"Intelligence Without Interruption"** principles:

1. **Native Browser Foundation**: Built as a complete Chromium-based browser with deep system integration, bypassing extension limitations
2. **Memory Layer**: Records and synthesizes your complete browsing life—including ambient thoughts, incomplete ideas, and cross-session patterns—into a rich contextual memory graph with specialized "Sandbox" storage for half-formed concepts
3. **Assistant Layer**: Provides always-on, intuitive assistance through natural language, voice commands, contextual insights, and proactive workflow guidance
4. **Integration Layer**: Natively bridges browsing with external tools (email, GitHub, VS Code, YouTube) through intelligent automation and cross-context connections
5. **Voice Flow Layer**: Listens to your natural thinking process during research, captures relevant spoken ideas, and surfaces them as "aha!" moments when contextually appropriate—all processed locally with zero audio retention

**The Vision**: A seamless, standalone browsing experience where your research patterns inform coding suggestions, your voice notes during exploration connect to future projects, your email context enhances GitHub workflows, and your captured insights become proactive guidance—all unified in a privacy-first browser that feels like an intuitive extension of your mind. Spur eliminates the need for separate tools, extensions, or apps—everything happens within your browsing environment.

### Target Users
- **Power Browsers**: Professionals who live in their browser and need intelligent workflow enhancement without app switching
- **Knowledge Workers**: Researchers, writers, analysts who need pattern recognition, idea capture, and cross-context connections during browsing
- **Developers**: Coders who want contextual assistance, voice-driven navigation, and seamless integration with IDEs and GitHub directly from the browser
- **Creative Professionals**: Designers and strategists who think out loud during research and need incomplete concepts preserved and resurfaced
- **Productivity Enthusiasts**: Users seeking a unified browsing environment that understands workflows, captures natural thinking, and eliminates tool fragmentation
- **Privacy-Conscious Professionals**: Those who want complete control over their browsing data with local-first processing and optional encrypted sync

**Key User Need**: A single, intelligent browsing environment that captures their complete digital workflow—visual, textual, and spoken—while maintaining privacy and performance, eliminating the need for multiple apps, extensions, and context switching.

### Key Architecture Principles

1. **Native Browser Integration**: Built directly into Chromium core, bypassing extension limitations for full system control
2. **Unified Data Pipeline**: All browsing activity—including voice interactions, navigation patterns, and ambient thoughts—flows through one system
3. **Modular Skill System**: Assistant capabilities built as interchangeable "skills" that leverage the memory graph with native browser APIs
4. **Local-First Privacy**: All processing (including speech recognition) happens locally with zero raw audio retention and optional encrypted cloud backup
5. **Voice Flow Integration**: Natural language processing for explicit commands and ambient thought capture, seamlessly integrated into browsing workflows
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core browsing functionality available immediately, advanced intelligence features unlock through natural usage patterns
7. **Sandbox Memory**: Specialized storage for incomplete ideas with intelligent surfacing during relevant browsing contexts
8. **Cross-Platform Native**: Full desktop application with system tray integration, global shortcuts, and native notifications

## Open Source Component Integration (Browser-Enhanced)

### Required Integrations (Updated for Browser)

The existing open-source integrations remain critical, but now integrate directly into the native browser environment:

1. **Leon AI** - Modular skill system adapted for native browser execution
2. **Inbox Zero** - Email processing with native IMAP client integration
3. **Mailvelope** - Encryption with native keychain storage
4. **Gemma / VS Code Assistant** - Code assistance with native webview support
5. **Vosk.js** *(Enhanced)* - Offline speech recognition with native audio processing
6. **Steel Browser Components** *(NEW)* - Chromium integration layer and browser APIs

### Browser-Specific Integration Strategy

```
Phase 1: Browser Foundation
├── Fork Steel Browser repository
├── Integrate Spur as native modules (not extensions)
├── Set up cross-platform build system
├── Implement native UI components
└── Create browser-specific APIs for Spur

Phase 2: Native System Integration
├── System tray and global shortcuts
├── Native notifications and permissions
├── File system and OS integration
├── Audio processing with native microphone access
└── Platform-specific optimizations

Phase 3: Enhanced Browser Features
├── Intelligent tab management with memory awareness
├── Context-aware address bar and search
├── Native sidebar panels for assistant and memory
├── Voice-driven navigation and commands
├── Enhanced developer tools with Spur integration
```

**Critical**: All integrations must appear as native browser features. No extension icons, popup windows, or third-party branding. Users should experience Spur as integral browser functionality.

## Privacy & Security Framework (Browser-Native)

### Core Privacy Principles *(Enhanced for Browser)*
1. **Local-First Browser**: All processing including speech recognition happens natively on user's device
2. **Zero Audio Retention**: Raw audio never stored, transmitted, or retained—immediate deletion after processing
3. **Native User Control**: Platform-specific permission dialogs with granular browser controls
4. **Data Minimization**: Capture only browsing activity necessary for declared functionality
5. **Transparency**: Native status indicators for all Spur features and voice listening
6. **No Lock-in**: Complete data export including browsing history, memory, and voice transcripts
7. **Browser Security**: Regular Chromium security updates with Spur-specific hardening
8. **Voice Consent**: Explicit opt-in for voice flow with native permission management
