# Spur Super App - Agent Communication Protocol

## Agent Status Update Format

All agents must use this standardized format for all communications:

```
[AGENT_NAME] [TASK_ID] Status Update:
- Current Status: [In Progress/Complete/Blocked/Review]
- Progress: [Percentage complete or specific milestones achieved]
- Key Decisions: [Major architectural or implementation decisions made]
- Dependencies: [Outstanding dependencies on other agents or external factors]
- Risks/Issues: [Identified risks, blockers, or quality concerns]
- Next Steps: [Immediate next actions and timeline]
- Questions: [Specific questions requiring input from other agents]
- Coordination Needs: [Required collaboration with specific agents]
```

## Communication Channels

### Primary Communication
- **GitHub Issues**: For task tracking and formal discussions
- **Pull Requests**: For code review and collaboration
- **Slack/Teams**: For real-time communication and quick questions

### Documentation Updates
- **Technical Specifications**: `/docs/technical/`
- **API Documentation**: `/docs/api/`
- **User Documentation**: `/docs/user/`
- **Agent Updates**: `/docs/agent-status/`

### Meeting Cadence
- **Daily Standup**: Async written updates by 9:00 AM
- **Weekly Sync**: Monday 10:00 AM PST (60 minutes)
- **Code Reviews**: As needed, within 24 hours of PR submission
- **Emergency Sync**: Called by Master Agent for critical blockers

---

## Quality Assurance Protocol

### Code Review Requirements
- **Minimum Reviewers**: 2 agents per PR
- **Mandatory Reviewers**:
  - UI/UX Agent for all interface changes
  - Integration Agent for API changes
  - Production Agent for deployment/config changes
  - Assistant Core Agent for NLP/voice changes
- **Review Timeline**: 24 hours max for standard PRs
- **Critical PRs**: 4 hours max review turnaround

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: 85% minimum coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All cross-component workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Response time < 100ms, CPU < 3%
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

### Documentation Requirements
- **Code Comments**: All public APIs documented
- **Technical Specs**: Updated for all new features
- **User Docs**: Updated for user-facing changes
- **API Docs**: OpenAPI specifications maintained
- **Agent Docs**: Status updates and coordination notes

## Dependency Management

### Dependency Identification
- **Hard Dependencies**: Required for task completion
- **Soft Dependencies**: Nice to have for optimal implementation
- **External Dependencies**: Third-party APIs, services, libraries
- **Cross-Agent Dependencies**: Other agents' work required

### Dependency Resolution
1. **Identification**: Clearly document dependencies in status updates
2. **Prioritization**: Master Agent prioritizes critical dependencies
3. **Coordination**: Direct communication between dependent agents
4. **Escalation**: Unresolved dependencies escalated to Master Agent
5. **Tracking**: Dependencies tracked in GitHub issues and project board

### Blocker Protocol
- **Immediate Blockers**: Report within 1 hour of identification
- **Mitigation**: Provide alternative approaches if possible
- **Escalation**: Critical blockers immediately escalated
- **Resolution**: Daily follow-up until resolved

---

## Risk Management

### Risk Categories
- **Technical Risk**: Implementation challenges, performance issues
- **Integration Risk**: Cross-component compatibility issues
- **Timeline Risk**: Delays in dependent components
- **Quality Risk**: Bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance issues
- **Resource Risk**: Skill gaps, tooling limitations

### Risk Reporting
- **High Risk**: Immediate escalation to Master Agent
- **Medium Risk**: Document in status updates, discuss in weekly sync
- **Low Risk**: Monitor and track in agent documentation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: Proof of concepts, prototyping, expert consultation
- **Integration Risks**: Early integration testing, API contracts
- **Timeline Risks**: Buffer time, parallel task execution
- **Quality Risks**: Comprehensive testing, code reviews
- **Resource Risks**: Skill development, tool training

---

## Decision Making

### Agent Decision Authority
Each agent has full authority within their domain:
- **Assistant Core Agent**: NLP architecture, voice interfaces, skill systems
- **UI/UX Agent**: Design implementation, user experience, accessibility
- **Integration Agent**: API integrations, workflow automation, data processing
- **Production Agent**: Deployment, monitoring, security, documentation

### Cross-Agent Decisions
- **Architectural Decisions**: Master Agent + relevant agents
- **Quality Standards**: All agents must agree
- **Timeline Changes**: Master Agent final decision
- **Scope Changes**: Master Agent + stakeholder approval

### Decision Documentation
- **Rationale**: Document reasoning for all major decisions
- **Alternatives**: List considered alternatives
- **Impact**: Describe impact on other components
- **Timeline**: Implementation timeline
- **Risks**: Associated risks and mitigations

---

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Agent-Specific Metrics
- **Assistant Core Agent**: NLP accuracy, response time, voice recognition
- **UI/UX Agent**: Lighthouse scores, bundle size, accessibility compliance
- **Integration Agent**: API response times, sync success rates, accuracy metrics
- **Production Agent**: Deployment success, monitoring coverage, security scores

### Project-Level Metrics
- **Overall Progress**: Percentage of tasks completed
- **Quality Gates**: Number of gates passed/failed
- **Timeline Adherence**: Days ahead/behind schedule
- **Bug Rates**: Production vs. staging bug ratios
- **Performance**: System-wide performance metrics

### Reporting Schedule
- **Daily**: Agent-specific metrics
- **Weekly**: Project-level progress report
- **Bi-weekly**: Comprehensive quality assessment
- **Monthly**: Strategic review and planning

---

## Emergency Protocols

### Critical Incident Response
- **Definition**: System outage, security breach, data loss, major performance degradation
- **Response Time**: 1 hour maximum for all agents
- **Coordination**: Master Agent leads response effort
- **Communication**: Real-time updates via emergency channel
- **Resolution**: Continuous until incident resolved

### Rollback Procedures
- **Triggers**: Critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance degradation
- **Authority**: Master Agent can order rollback
- **Process**: Automated rollback to last stable version
- **Communication**: Immediate notification to all stakeholders
- **Analysis**: Post-mortem required for all rollbacks

### Escalation Matrix
- **Level 1**: Agent-to-agent direct communication
- **Level 2**: Weekly sync meeting discussion
- **Level 3**: Master Agent intervention
- **Level 4**: Stakeholder escalation (emergency only)
